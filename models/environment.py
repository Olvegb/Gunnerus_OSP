"""Environment FMU: Changes the enviroment during simulation.

Reads the wind, wave and current parameters from the config file. All outputs are in
the earth-fixed NED frame; the FMU knows nothing about the vessel.

Wind speed, split into three parts that are each given as their own output.
The total, V(t) = V_mean + V_sv(t) + V_gust(t), is calculated where it is used.

  - V_mean   mean wind speed, constant.
  - V_sv     slowly varying wind: a first-order Gauss-Markov process
             (Fossen, Handbook of Marine Craft Hydrodynamics and Motion
             Control), discretised exactly so it does not depend on the
             step size:
                 x[k+1] = a * x[k] + sigma * sqrt(1 - a^2) * w[k],
                 a = exp(-dt / T),  w[k] ~ N(0, 1)
  - V_gust   gusts: sum of harmonics from the NORSOK N-003 / ISO 19901-1
             (Froya) wind spectrum, with random phases:
                 V_gust(t) = sum_i sqrt(2 S(f_i) df) cos(2 pi f_i t + phi_i)

Wind direction (where the wind comes from, clockwise from north):

    beta(t) = beta_mean + rate * t + beta_sv(t)

  - rate     constant turning rate, for a steady veer.
  - beta_sv  slow random variation, the same Gauss-Markov process as V_sv.

A part is switched off by setting it to 0 in the config file: std = 0 for
V_sv, n_components = 0 for V_gust, rate_deg_per_s = 0 and std_deg = 0 for
the direction.
