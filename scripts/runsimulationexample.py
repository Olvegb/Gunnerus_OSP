"""Example: a 1000 s simulation of RV Gunnerus.

Run from the repo folder, with the conda environment master active:

    python scripts/runsimulationexample.py

run_simulation() builds the FMUs that have changed, runs the system and saves
the results in results/<time stamp>_gunnerus_1000s/: one CSV per FMU, and a
copy of the config and the system structure the run used.
