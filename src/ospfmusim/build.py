"""Builds the FMUs from the models in this package.

An FMU is one model script (the class that inherits Fmi2Slave) plus a copy of
the model folders of this package in its resources/. The model imports its
help functions through the package, as ospfmusim.<folder>.helpfunctions.<module>.

Every FMU gets the same copy. The FMUs share one Python interpreter when they
run, so a module name must mean the same code in all of them: three different
helpfunctions/ folders at the top of resources/ would collide.

An FMU is only built again when a file in the model folders is newer than the
FMU. Changes to the config files in configs/ and to OspSystemStructure.xml do
NOT need a rebuild.

From the repo folder, with the conda environment master active:

    python -m ospfmusim.build            # build the FMUs that have changed
    python -m ospfmusim.build --force    # build every FMU again
