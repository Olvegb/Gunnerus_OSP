"""ThrustAllocation FMU: the thrust and azimuth command for each thruster.

The FMU has only ONE parameter, config_path, and reads the thrusters itself
from the config file when the simulation starts. The allocation is
helpfunctions.allocation.ThrustAllocator; this file only moves values
between FMI variables and that code.

The thrusters are slots: the k-th [[thrusters]] entry in config.toml is
thruster<k>_... here. The variables therefore don't depend on the config,
so a new layout needs no rebuild. Slots without a thruster output 0.

The FMU's life cycle:
  1. __init__                   Runs when the FMU is loaded (and when it is
                                built). The variables are registered here.
                                The config file is NOT read here.
  2. the master sets values     config_path and the inputs get their values
                                from OspSystemStructure.xml.
  3. exit_initialization_mode   Runs once, right before the simulation
                                starts. The config file is read here.
  4. do_step                    Runs every time step. The allocation runs here.
