Forbidden thrust directions and the allowed arcs between them.

Angles are thrust angles in degrees: 0 deg pushes forward, increasing toward
starboard (layout.py). Copied from the DNV-ST-0111 project
(dp_capability/models/forbidden_zones.py); the logic does not depend on the
frame, only the angle convention in the docstrings changed.
