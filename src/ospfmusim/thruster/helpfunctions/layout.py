Data containers for the thruster layout, and loading a layout from the TOML config file.

Coordinate system (Fossen body frame)
-------------------------------------
- Body axes: right-handed, x forward, y to starboard, z down. The origin is
  the vessel model's body-frame origin; agree on it with the vessel model.
- Forces are positive pushing the vessel forward (surge) and to starboard
  (sway). The yaw moment N is positive clockwise seen from above (bow to
  starboard). A force (fx, fy) at (x, y) gives N = x*fy - y*fx.
- Thrust angles: 0 deg pushes forward, increasing toward starboard, so
  90 deg pushes to starboard and 270 deg to port. This is atan2(fy, fx).

Public functions take angles in degrees.
