"""Sea state: turns a wave spectrum into a set of regular wave components.

Each component is a cosine wave with its own amplitude, frequency, phase and
direction. Adding all the components together gives an irregular sea.

Regular sea:       one regular wave (sea_type "regular"), see regular_wave().
Irregular sea (sea_type "irregular"), from a wave spectrum:
  Long-crested sea:  all waves travel in the mean direction (spreading "none").
  Short-crested sea: the energy is spread over several directions around the
                     mean direction (spreading "cos2s").

The directions are stored RELATIVE to the mean direction (direction_offsets).
The mean direction itself is added last, in directions_to(), so the
environment block can change it without building a new sea.

The waves block sends out a fixed number of components (n_waves): the ones
with the most energy (keep_strongest). This is what sea_from_settings()
does, and both the FMU (models/waves.py) and the tests use that function.
