"""Waves FMU: describes the sea as a set of regular wave components.

Written the same way as models/test.py. The FMU has only ONE parameter,
config_path, and reads the wave settings itself from [waves] in the config
file when the simulation starts. The physics is in wave_cosim/; this file only
moves values between FMI variables and that code.

The FMU only describes the sea. It does NOT calculate any forces on the
vessel: the hull FMU does that from the wave components sent out here.

  - inputs:   H_s, T_p, wave_direction_deg, from the Environment FMU
  - outputs:  N_WAVES wave components: wave<k>_amplitude, wave<k>_omega,
              wave<k>_phase, wave<k>_direction_deg, k = 1 ... N_WAVES,
              and kept_energy_fraction
  - settings: [waves] in config.toml (sea type, spectrum, spreading, grid)

The hull FMU must use exactly this wave elevation (t = simulation time,
x = north, y = east, direction in radians):

    zeta = sum_k amplitude_k * cos(omega_k * t - k_k * (x cos(direction_k) + y sin(direction_k)) - phase_k)
    k_k = omega_k^2 / g    (deep water)
