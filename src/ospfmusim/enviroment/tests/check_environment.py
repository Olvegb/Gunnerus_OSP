"""Check the Environment FMU code WITHOUT building an FMU and without OSP.
Run from the repo folder:  python src/ospfmusim/enviroment/tests/check_environment.py

Creates the Environment class from enviroment/environment.py with the config the simulation uses,
or with a copy of it where some values are changed, and checks:

  1. Everything switched off: the outputs are constant and equal to the config.
  2. Slowly varying wind (Gauss-Markov): zero mean, the right std and time
     constant, and the same statistics for another step size.
  3. Gusts: the std of the gust signal matches the NORSOK spectrum
     integrated over [f_min, f_max]. Zero mean.
  4. Wind direction: a constant turning rate gives mean + rate * t, and the
     output always stays in [0, 360).
  5. Current: north and east components match speed and direction.
  6. Seed: the same seed gives the same wind, another seed another wind.
